# mat2pcd
transform .mat to .pcd

You need to read your .mat file in Matlab and run the "mat2txt.m".
Then we will get a file named "data.txt". Copy it to your c++ project and run another code "txt2pcd.cpp".
We will get "pointcloud.pcd"

The c++ project need two library: opencv3 and pcl. If you need .pcd file, I belive you have installed them.
